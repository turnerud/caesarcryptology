EncodeCaesar takes the message and the shift for the rotation, and gives the ciphertext or encrypted message.
DecodeCaesarShift takes a ciphertext and key and decodes it to the plaintext.
DecodeCaesar takes a cyphertext encoded and decodes the plaintext. It takes the plaintext as an input, and will ask for a shift, but the user input for shift is irrelevant. It only asks because I call DecodeCaesarShift. The program doesn't know the user input and instead uses an algorithm to match the cipher text with the plain text and gives the probable shift/key.

he first function you should write is called EncodeCaesar, takes the message and the shift for the rotation (to be applied for every letter), and gives the cyphertext (the encoded message). The second function you should write is DecodeCaesarShift, takes a cyphertext and a shift for the rotation used to make the cyphertext and decodes the original message (the plaintext, the original message encoded into the cyphertext). The third function you should write is DecodeCaesar, which takes any cyphertext encoded using the Caesar cypher and decodes the plaintext from it, it also should take the plaintext as an input to use for verification of breaking the cipher, but not output that as its output (Hint: you should use DecodeCaesarShift as a helper function).
